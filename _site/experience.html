        <p>Currently still a student, I have worked with quite a lot of programming tools already. Here I have been in dedicated programming classes for 22 hours a week since I enrolled in spring of 2018. Throughout this experience, learning new and difficult concepts has proved incredibly rewarding and fun. I have been involved in a lot of co-op programming projects that you can see on my GitHub page. I am looking forward to learning and growing more as a developer.</p>

        <p>I have had the privilege over the past year to build websites for two local companies. Iâ€™ve utilized my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git to create not only a commercial website for Lancaster Laundry Works; but also, a free-of-charge website for a local nonprofit church. Improving my semantics, syntactical knowledge, and workflow with each successive project.</p>
